# Posting stats to a Webhook

> ðŸ”¥ This integration does **not** require a sponsorship. Enjoy!

This action can also send the results to a webhook of your preference. This way, you can send them to [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Automate.io](https://automate.io/) and more, to take actions based on the results.

Just send a URL in the `webhook` parameter. For example:

```yml
name: Pull Request Stats

on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 16 * * 5'

jobs:
  stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run pull request stats
        uses: flowwer-dev/pull-request-stats@master
        with:
          repositories: 'piedpiper/repo1,piedpiper/repo2'
          webhook: 'https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/XXXXXXXX'
          # webhook: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_URL }} You may want to store this value as a secret.
```

This action will calculate the pull request reviewers' stats for the repos `piedpiper/repo1` and `piedpiper/repo2`, each Friday at 14pm and send the results to the webhook using a `POST` request.
