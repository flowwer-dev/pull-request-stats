# Posting Stats to a Webhook

> **ðŸ”¥ This integration does not require sponsorship. Enjoy!**

This action allows you to send results to a webhook of your choice. This means you can integrate with platforms like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), [Automate.io](https://automate.io/), and more, to perform actions based on the results.

## How to Use the Webhook Parameter

To use this feature, provide a URL in the `webhook` parameter. For example:

```yml
name: Pull Request Stats

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 16 * * 5'

jobs:
  stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run pull request stats
        uses: flowwer-dev/pull-request-stats@main
        with:
          repositories: 'piedpiper/repo1,piedpiper/repo2'
          webhook: 'https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/123456/XXXXXXXX'
          # webhook: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_URL }} You may want to store this value as a secret.
```

This configuration calculates pull request stats for the repositories `piedpiper/repo1` and `piedpiper/repo2` every Friday at 16:00 (UTC). The results are sent to the specified webhook URL via a `POST` request.

## Webhook Payload Structure

The webhook payload includes detailed information:
