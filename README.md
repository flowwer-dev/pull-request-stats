# Pull Request Stats
Github action to print relevant stats about Pull Request reviewers.

The objective of this action is to:

* Reduce the time taken to review the pull requests.
* Encourage quality on reviews.

Running this action will add a section at the bottom of your pull requests description.

```yml

## Examples

**Minimal config**

Add this to the file `.github/workflows/stats.yml` in your repo:

```yml
name: Pull Request Stats

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run pull request stats
        uses: Sportsbet-Internal/pull-request-stats@master
```

This config will:

* Calculate the reviewer stats for the current repo in the lasts 30 days
* Add links to the historial data
* Sort results by the "total reviews" column by default

**Visual config**

Add this to the file `.github/workflows/stats.yml`:

```yml
name: Pull Request Stats

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run pull request stats
        uses: Sportsbet-Internal/pull-request-stats@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.ADD_A_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          organization: 'Sportsbet-Internal'

## Stats

The stats are calculated as following:

* **Time to review:** It is the time taken by a reviewer from the _Pull Request publication_ or the last _Commit push_ (whatever happens last) to the first time the pull request is reviewed.
* **Time to review:** It is the **median** of the _times to review_ of all Pull Requests reviewed by a person in the period.
* **Total reviews:** It is the count of all Pull Requests reviewed by a person in the period.
* **Total comments:** It is the count of all the comments while reviewing other user's Pull Requests in the period (comments in own PRs don't count).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>The action is printing an empty table.</summary>

  1. Make sure the repositories have pull request reviews during the configured `period`.
  2. When specifying `repositories` or `organization` paramaters, a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) is required in the `token` parameter.
  3. If providing a Personal Access Token, make sure it has the `repo` permission for the projects you want.

<details>
  <summary>I get the error "Error commenting on the pull request...".</summary>

  This error happens when the action's permissions are configured as `read` by the organization. To fix it, overwrite them by adding a [`permissions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) configuration in the workflow file. The minimum required permissions are `contents: read` and `pull-requests: write`:

  ```yml
  jobs:
  stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Run pull request stats
        uses: Sportsbet-Internal/pull-request-stats@master
  ```
