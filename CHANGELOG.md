# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.1.0] - 2024-12-22
### Added
- Adds new available stats: `reviewedAdditions`, `reviewedDeletions`, `reviewedLines`, `totalObservations`, `medianObservations`, `revisionSuccessRate`, `additions`, `deletions` and `lines`.

### Changes
- `commentsPerReview` is calculated now as the median, not the average.

## [3.0.0] - 2024-12-12
### Added
- New `stats` option to specify the stats to be calculated.

### Breaking changes
- Deprecated the kebab case options: `publish-as`, `disable-links`, `sort-by`, `slack-webhook`, `slack-channel` and `teams-webhook`. Now you need to use the camel case format: `publishAs`, `disableLinks`, `sortBy`, `slackWebhook`, `slackChannel` and `teamsWebhook`.`
- The values for `sortBy` have changed. `REVIEWS`, `TIME`, `COMMENTS` are invalid. Now you need to use the full name of the stat that will be used for sorting, for example: `totalComments`, `timeToReview`...
- The JSON output for the action and the JSON payload for the webhook have changed. Check the new format in the [webhook documentation](/docs/webhook.md).
- Renamed branch `master` to `main`.
